  In terms of photography result, it's hard to say one is better than the other. The picture quality taken by a DSLR is unquestionably good, but the BV6300 Pro's camera is feature-focused. It has a Samsung® 16MP quad rear camera setup which features Slow Motion, HDR, 120° Ultra-wide field of view, Macro, Night mode, contributing to pro photography results. In the case of HDR on the BV6300 Pro, it highlights the best parts of each photo, sparing you the hassle of post-possessing work. The Slow Motion slows everything down, creating a surreal timewarp effect in a video. The 120° ultra-wide angle lens makes it a breeze to capture broad natural landscape. Tap the Macro function, you can have fun to explore the microworld. And the Night mode enables you to take bright photos even in a dimly lit room or moonlit beaches.

And it's also a time-consuming process. If you're a casual photographer or one that is more into taking Selfie images, the BV6300 Pro camera suits you the best.
